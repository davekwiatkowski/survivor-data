One that believes things are \"rights versus privileges.\" Also, unorganized people or things, close-minded individuals and people who think you \"owe\" them something.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>What's your personal claim to fame</strong>? Retirement from the U.S. Army. I served over 21 years in the Army and I was an Army officer captain. I served in the transportation unit and in a psychological Operations Battalion as an executive officer and I was the only female officer in the organization, yet still chosen to be second in command. I have been to several countries, including Iraq, Afghanistan, Turkey, Dubai, France, Bratislava, Slovakia, Italy, and Germany.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I was put in the most unusual and extreme situations and conditions and survived better than most. I was in isolated conditions where life's bare necessities were limited. While deployed to Iraq in 2003-2004, I went months with only taking bottle water showers. The supply lines were compromised so often I was forced to make a decision to either wash with my daily bottled water or consume it. I jumped from several different Military aircrafts and did drown-proofing that consisted of water survival.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>While deployed to Afghanistan, I was put in situations that required me to influence the local \"elders\" (leaders) of our U.S. missions in their country while at the same time earning their trust. This posed a huge issue because one, I am a female (and their beliefs with females are VERY different than ours) and two, I was an American. However, I was able to gain the trust of the local people as well as many elders.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?</strong> First would be my guitar because I have one and played a little in college but it would be a chance for me to have music and learn at the same time. Next would be paper and pen to document my experience. My memory is not the best and I want to capture as much as possible to remind me of the once in a lifetime experience I had. Finally, an iPod to listen to music.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Which&nbsp;<em>Survivor</em>&nbsp;contestant are you most like?</strong> Michaela Bradshaw because not only was she fit, outspoken, attractive, and witty, she also spoke her mind and was extremely good at challenges. And when she won, she wasn't afraid to celebrate. She expressed her emotions on her face which is very similar to me. My friends tell me even when my mouth is shut, they know what I am saying because my facial expression \"talks.\" I'm not afraid to express my feelings and I put a lot out there. I want to give my best self and Michaela never gave up. It was clearly depicted in the episode where she lost her top. I'll do whatever it takes to win, with or without my top.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Why do you think you'll \"survive\"&nbsp;<em>Survivor</em>?</strong> I am strong, hardworking, loyal, determined, and able to figure out most things. I am very versatile and by my looks, most wouldn't expect it. I am like the snake that you don't know is there until bitten. I have a strong ability to win people over and get them to want to do what I want just by actively listening.\"</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div class=\"flex-video\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ol1Z2YCTXz4?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div>", "season": 36, "genderData": { "gender": "female", "confidence": 0.9989327641408752 } }, { "name": "Angelina Keeley", "banner": "https://www.truedorktimes.com/survivor/cast/images/angelina-keeley-bd3.jpg", "bio": "<p>Official CBS <em><a href=\"https://www.cbs.com/shows/survivor/cast/215973/\">David vs. Goliath</a></em><a href=\"https://www.cbs.com/shows/survivor/cast/215973/\"> bio</a> excerpts (9/5/18):</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>\"<strong>Hobbies:&nbsp;</strong>Traveling the world, trying new things, political activism, hosting margarita nights, dancing, workout classes, anything involving French bulldogs, and starting my non-profit Ready to Run, which encourages, empowers, and equips middle school and high school aged girls to run for student government positions in their schools.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Pet peeves:&nbsp;</strong>Indecisiveness, when people don't vote, and when people don't like dogs.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Three words to describe you:&nbsp;</strong>Intuitive, persuasive, and loving.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>What's your personal claim to fame?</strong> I was elected to serve over 15,000+ students at Stanford University as Student Body President, and I was the first Latina to hold the position.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Who or what is your inspiration in life?</strong> My parents. They have both worked incredibly hard for everything they have and to make a good life for us kids. Because of them, and their never-ending love and support and belief in me, I have been able to accomplish everything I've ever set my mind to.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>If you could have three things on the island what would they be and why?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> A copy of Maya Angelou's \"Still I Rise,\"&nbsp;a poem that sums up my mindset for life and&nbsp;<em>Survivor</em>. A radio so I could listen to the news every day. Not knowing what's going on in the world around me is going to be one of the hardest parts of the game for me. And make-up. I'm not going to front, I wear it every day.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Which&nbsp;<em>Survivor</em>&nbsp;contestant are you most like?&nbsp;</strong> Natalie Anderson for her intellect, sense of timing and character. Parvati for her charm, social awareness and cunningness. And both women for their warrior spirits and overall badassness.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>What's your reason for being on&nbsp;<em>Survivor</em>?</strong> Survivor is the ultimate challenge of grit, savviness, and strategy. As a naturally competitive person, I want to test myself, my abilities and my limits. As a military spouse, I believe we are most of the strongest and most adaptable people.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I want to win because my husband will head out on his second deployment this year, and I want to be a source of strength and inspiration for other military families who have endured long months and years away from their soldier. Also, winning a million dollars is obviously a huge motivation--like many Americans I have a lot of student debt from school, and being able to pay that off would be a game changer.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Why do you think you'll \"survive\"&nbsp;<em>Survivor</em>?&nbsp;</strong> I have always been an extremely optimistic and positive person, I always see the best in everything/everyone and make the most out of even the hardest situations. Even though I'm not super outdoorsy, I'm a quick learner and always down to try something new.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I'm also scrappy, adaptable, smart, fun, and determined as hell. Most importantly though, my love for people, empathy, and emotional awareness are what I credit for much of what I've accomplished in my 28 years of life. I'm able to get along with anyone, and people tend to trust me.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Lastly, I'm not afraid to take risks and play hard. I will use all of these skills, at the right time with the right people, in order to make it all the way to the end.\"</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <!--div class=\"flex-video\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uehSMMs92ww?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div -->", "season": 37, "genderData": { "gender": "female", "confidence": 0.9866666666666667 } }, { "name": "Angie Layton", "banner": "https://www.truedorktimes.com/survivor/cast/images/angie-layton-bd3.jpg", "bio": "<p>Excerpts from her CBS.com <em>Survivor: Philippines</em> <a href=\"http://www.cbs.com/shows/survivor/cast/159986/\">bio page</a> (8/24/12):</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>\"<strong>Personal Claim to Fame:</strong>&nbsp;I’m Miss Utah Teen USA 2010 and 3rd runner-up Miss Teen USA 2010.&nbsp;<br> <strong>Hobbies:</strong>&nbsp;All sports, working out, scrapbooking and hanging with my peeps.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <strong>Pet Peeves:</strong>&nbsp;Lazy people and slow drivers.&nbsp;<br> <strong>If You Could Have 3 Things on The Island What Would They Be and Why?</strong>&nbsp;The only thing I would bring is my camera so I could take pictures and scrapbook my journey.<br> <strong><em>Survivor</em> Contestant You Are Most Like:</strong>&nbsp;Fabio - because people underestimated him for a “dumb blonde” and he used that to his advantage.

I want to prove to myself, my family and my friends that anything is possible and to give all opportunities a go.”&nbsp;<br> <br> A&nbsp;<em>Survivor</em>&nbsp;super fan, Anita has been in training to show the younger generation that she can keep up not only mentally but physically as well. Going to the gym, doing pilates, step classes not to mention taking part in marathons and events like Tough Mudder.&nbsp;<br> <br> “A year ago, I could only run 2kms at a time then I set myself a challenge to run a full marathon before I turned 50. Well in August last year, I completed the Sunshine Coast Marathon. I was 49. Done in five hours. I can do anything!”&nbsp;<br> <br> A firm believer that life is short and not one to live with regrets, Anita is the number one fan of Oprah Winfrey – she even got Oprah’s signature tattooed on her neck!&nbsp;<br> <br> Anita has four adult and teenage kids and loves nothing more than making them proud and trying to be a good role model to them. She’s hoping that winning the title of sole survivor will inspire them and also help the family financially.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <br> Wanting to be a hero on the game, Anita knows that sometimes you have to leave your morals back at home saying, “In <em>Survivor</em>, moral boundaries must be crossed and it’s part of the game and I accept that. I will do anything to win the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <br> “I want to be a hero but don’t get me wrong, I will backstab, tell a few lies and align myself with whoever I feel will help my game. All is fair in the game of <em>Survivor</em>.”\"</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>\"Meet Anita\" pre-game interview video (YouTube): </p> <div class=\"flex-video\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/g9sH3NRyhBg?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div>", "season": 3, "genderData": { "gender": "female", "confidence": 0.9969230769230769 } }, { "name": "Anna Khait", "banner": "https://www.truedorktimes.com/survivor/cast/images/anna-khait-bd3.jpg", "bio": "<p>From her official CBS <em>Survivor: Kaoh Rong</em> cast <a href=\"http://www.cbs.com/shows/survivor/cast/215170/\">bio page</a>: (1/20/16)</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>• Hobbies:</strong> Handball, reading, singing and playing piano.</p> <p>• <strong>Pet Peeves:</strong> Arrogance, ignorance and when someone picks on someone less fortunate.</p> <p>• <strong>If You Could Have 3 Things on the Island What Would They Be and Why?</strong> A razor because I hate hair; a deck of cards because I love card games; and a toothbrush because who loves bad breath?</p> <p>• <strong><em>Survivor</em> Contestant You Are Most Like:</strong> Parvati.

As the head women's soccer coach at the Southwest Baptist University in Missouri, he is called 'Coach Wade,' but he also goes by 'Maestro' due to role as an artistic director and conductor of a California symphony orchestra. A skilled musician, Benjamin was traveling the world playing the trumpet before most kids could even spell 'trumpet.'</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;Wade sees coaching as another form of manipulation. 'You have to find out what everybody wants, what everybody needs, what they think they want, what think they need and then you have to be the person that solves everything.' He knows these skills will be valuable in the game of&nbsp;<em>Survivor</em>.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>If Benjamin was asked to wear just one hat, it would be that of 'Renaissance Man.' Aside from setting the world record for the longest solo kayak expedition on the ocean (an amazing 6,132 miles), Wade has also been attacked by a tiger shark, stalked by a jaguar in the Amazon and has been bitten by a piranha on his right hand. To say that he is a Type A, Alpha male, who likes to control the environment around him may just be an understatement. Coach's dominant personality will be a force to be reckoned with in the game.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;Benjamin is single and currently splits his time in Bolivar, Mo, and Susanville, Calif.

There is no likeable hero who can coast all the way to the end and win with loyalty and mateship. In order to win, you need to play a strategic game.&nbsp;<br> <br> “I am going to be extremely likeable and perform well in challenges for my tribe but hidden behind my high performance and fun, goofy exterior will be some very villainous moves. The best way to ensure you are safe is to cause chaos in another section of camp. Just because I will do anything to achieve that won’t necessarily make me a heartless villain, I will just be a great game player.”&nbsp;<br> <br> Highly intelligent and competitive, Benji says he is a self-made millionaire working in some of the biggest places in the world from New York to Brazil. One to take chances, he moved to Brazil on a one-way flight and found out quickly that he needed to make some money.&nbsp;<br> <br> “I hustled. I immediately took on four different jobs, learnt algorithms and went onto become a bestselling author by paying other people to write books for me then used my marketing skills to sell them under my name. I even booked speaking gigs at universities in the US. I’ve never looked back and now run multiple businesses that bring in over one million dollars, just four years later.”&nbsp;<br> <br> Playing to win, Benji wants to take out the prize not only to prove he can but to help a charity that he founded called 10 Million Meals. “I will feed two million kids, I am determined to and winning the money would be a huge help towards that. I can and will win <em>Survivor</em>!”\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p>\"Meet Benji\" pre-game interview video (YouTube): </p> <div class=\"flex-video\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ApbnbC3zBS8?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div>", "season": 3, "genderData": { "gender": "unknown", "confidence": null } }, { "name": "Bi Nguyen", "banner": "https://www.truedorktimes.com/survivor/cast/images/bi-nguyen-bd3.jpg", "bio": "<p>Official CBS <em><a href=\"https://www.cbs.com/shows/survivor/cast/215972/\">David vs. Goliath</a></em><a href=\"https://www.cbs.com/shows/survivor/cast/215972/\"> bio</a> excerpts (9/15/18):</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>\"<strong>What's your personal claim to fame?</strong> If I were to choose one accomplishment I'm most proud of, it would have to be my debut victory. I was the underdog. I took on an opponent much more experienced than I was for my first fight. I beat her and retired her. I also gained my nickname and fan base after that victory. I've had 22 victories after that, but that one I'm most proud of.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Who or what is your inspiration in life?</strong> My sister Twee. She is resilient and hard working. She was in college tutoring calculus while learning English and graduated top of her class.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>If you could have three things on the island what would they be and why?&nbsp;</strong> I would bring one of my favorite books, probably one about mental strength. I would also bring underwear. Lastly, I would bring a hair tie, because my hair is a pain.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Which&nbsp;<em>Survivor</em>&nbsp;contestant are you most like?</strong> Ben from Season 35. I am physically strong, assertive, but quiet and observant as well.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>What's your reason for being on&nbsp;<em>Survivor</em>?</strong> My first season I watched was Season 35,&nbsp;<em>Heroes vs. Healers vs. Hustlers</em>. I thought I could definitely dominate this experience and win. If I would've seen this show earlier, I would've applied years ago.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Why do you think you'll \"survive\"&nbsp;<em>Survivor</em>?</strong> I am an elite athlete. I would win many challenges and would be a great asset to the team. I was born and lived in rural Vietnam until I was 9 years old so my natural survival skills are impeccable. I've sold cars for a living and can convince people of what they want and need. Being a fighter, I'm a great strategist. Before a fight, besides the physical training, we watch and study film on our opponents to assess and strategize how to defeat them.

In 1974, Lockley received a Bachelor of Science degree from Greenville College in Illinois. With a career in education, he then served 19 years as a high school teacher, athletic director and coach.

He is an active member in the Olney Rotary Club.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Lockley enjoys hunting, water sports and walking. He describes himself as enthusiastic, ambitious and humorous. If he could hold any political office, he'd like to be a state congressman because he could influence laws and programs that would help his state grow and develop while maintaining contact with the local people. He is most proud of raising his three children. He is doing this because he loves competition, challenges and the outdoors and a chance to win some money. If he wins the $1 million, he's going to buy a 4-Wheel Drive Pick-Up truck.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Lockley currently resides in Olney, Ill., with his wife, Cindy, who is a counselor at his school.

If you are lazy and also a liar, I won't like you. In fact, it angers me when people act lazy and try to manipulate everyone around them and ruin everything. Now, those pet peeves are going to be alive and well in the land of&nbsp;<em>Survivor</em>. Good thing I know how to dish it right back. I have been around people like that my whole life and I know how to deal with it. So yeah, my title of Most Dramatic, in the face of a bunch of liars will be, shall we say... interesting.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>What's your personal claim to fame?</strong> My greatest accomplishment was being on a 5th Avenue Versace billboard! It was by no means the end all and be all of where I want to be in life, but it was a major accomplishment. To me it was an accumulation of everything I've worked hard for finally getting justified. It was a huge symbol of perseverance and it was gratifying. I rely on my own self-motivation and have accomplished stuff that was difficult and took legit perseverance, but winning&nbsp;<em>Survivor</em>&nbsp;will top all that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Who or what is your inspiration in life?</strong> My ma is my hero. But it wasn't always so. Growing up, my mom and I didn't have the best relationship. She was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) at 27 and had me at 34. God bless her. A lot of side effects of MS don't just affect the body, but the brain as well, such as depression. So as a kid, I couldn't handle or understand what was going on. I look back at my childhood and most memories of my mom and I were difficult. She would have seizures during my baseball games, at my school where she tutored, and the side effects of all the medications made it difficult to have a normal relationship with her.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>When I was 12, my parents split and the next couple years were even tougher as her disease progressed. If it wasn't for my father telling me I needed to rise above the past and grow up, I would have continued to struggle. When I was told she had two months to live I decided to become a man at 17, and our past struggles brought us even closer. Through the years, our relationship grew, and our love and respect for each other brought our relationship to all-time highs. None of this would be possible if she hadn't beat the odds for almost 10 years now.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I will always idolize her perseverance, her grit, and her faith in God. She is the greatest hero anyone can have and I live through her. She never quit or gave in when she was told she had two months to live, so why should I ever quit or give in when life \"gets hard?\" Want to talk about a survivor? That's my mom.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?</strong> First would be a good luck necklace my mom gave me when she almost died. I've been wearing it ever since and crazy good things have happened since. Also, lotion, so I could give awesome massages and bond with the hot girls on my tribe, and finally a second bottle of lotion—I plan to be on the island for a while, and maybe I'll get one if I play my cards right!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Which&nbsp;<em>Survivor</em>&nbsp;contestant are you most like?</strong> From Season 33, I would be a mix of Ken and Michaela. I would provide food like Ken. But unlike Ken, my social game would be on point. I would have Michaela's fire, determination, and athletic ability. I would also be blunt like her, but would do a better job of building relationships. In previous seasons, I would have the social and ladies game like Joe. Joe is eye candy and smooth. I would try and form a coalition with someone like him. He would be my shield and then I would cut him later in the game. As far as Season 36, I won't know whether to play the game like a Florida panther—stealthy and in the shadows, or like a lion—dominating its tribe. I may have to be both, depending on the dynamic of the game.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>What's your reason for being on&nbsp;<em>Survivor</em>?</strong> The game itself, and to spread the awareness of MS. 2.3 million people worldwide have MS and there is no cure! For me, like life, I've been finding ways to survive for a long time. I want to apply all my experiences with different personalities, and put them to the ultimate test. I want to compete and I want to win. This is a competition of survival. I am a type-A personality and I cannot stand the thought of losing. I have tunnel vision when it comes to winning and there is nothing out there, competition wise, like&nbsp;<em>Survivor</em>.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <div class=\"flex-video\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DfIaw40LUkY?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div>", "season": 36, "genderData": { "gender": "male", "confidence": 0.8914027149321267 } }, { "name": "Chrissy Hofbeck", "banner": "https://www.truedorktimes.com/survivor/cast/images/chrissy-hofbeck-bd3.jpg", "bio": "<p>Excerpts from her official CBS <em>Heroes v.

She paid her way through college working nights as a passenger service agent for a major airline at Boston's Logan International Airport, spent time as a receptionist at a high-end hair salon, and has even worked as a \"historical interpreter\" (a tour guide in costume) at historic homes in Salem, Massachusetts.

At the age of 12, Coria lost her father when he was shot and killed in an unsolved murder. After her father died, her mother raised her and her four siblings all by herself.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Coria started her career in law enforcement at the age of 14. She was a Santa Monica police explorer, police cadet, parking enforcement officer, community service officer, Santa Monica College police officer and then Santa Monica police officer. She has also worked as a waitress, sales clerk and as an instructor at the El Camino College Reserve Police Academy. She also volunteered for the Santa Monica Police Activities League and taught dance to kids.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Coria has been a police officer for almost 14 years. During this time, she has gone through two life-threatening experiences. First, she was nearly crushed to death when she was pinned up against her police car by another vehicle driven by an intoxicated driver. Second, she sustained an almost career-ending injury to her left arm after being shot by a murder suspect during a hostage standoff which occurred on the Santa Monica Pier on July 4, 2000. She sustained severe bone and nerve damage and was initially advised by doctors that she might lose her arm. After extensive reconstructive surgery she was told by doctors that she would never be able to have full use of her arm again nor return back to work. Through dedication, determination, faith and perseverance, she beat the odds and regained use of her arm. In 2001, she returned back to work full duty patrolling the streets of Santa Monica. After such hardships, she manages to keep upbeat and continues to have a positive outlook on life.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In addition to patrol duty, Coria has worked as a technical consultant on the movie \"Angel Eyes\" with Jennifer Lopez. She was also on E! Entertainment for <em>Red Carpet Confidential</em> and received a makeover on the show. She appeared on the Discovery Health Channel, a Police Rape Awareness video, MTV's <em>Y2K Ball</em> and numerous news programs as a result of being shot on July 4, 2000.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Coria enjoys playing volleyball, dancing, exercising and running.

Born and raised in Walpole, Massachusetts, he was very involved in athletics, especially football, skiing and track. While in high school, Dan played on a varsity football team, which had a long tradition of winning, a tradition that has helped shape his strong work-ethic. He graduated from The University of Massachusetts, Amherst with a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Political Science &amp; English and later would earn his law degree from Syracuse University College of Law where he was also a member of the Moot Court Honor Society.<br> <br> Charismatic, hard working and goal oriented, most of Dan's traits were formed from the influence provided by his parents and a select few coaches and teachers. As a young boy, his father became disabled, leaving his mother to care for his family and, eventually, his ill grandmother, all while working as a full-time nurse. In addition, Dan credits his mother's work ethic and unselfish attitude for his strong desire to overcome any obstacles in his career and personal life.<br> <br> Dan has practiced law in Boston for five years, which helped him to purchase several investment properties. However, dedicating so much of his time to his practice left him depressed and feeling less than fulfilled with his life. Prior to leaving for SURVIVOR, he sold off a number of investments and spent time away from his job, in an effort to focus more on himself and his friends and family. He believes this recent awareness, along with having an increased appreciation for the people in his life rather than material possessions, will help him succeed not only in his personal life, but on SURVIVOR.<br> <br> Attractive, athletic, single and a lawyer, Dan is set to make a big impression on his competitors. Dan's hobbies include skiing, running, biking, weight training and cooking. Currently, he is training to compete in his first triathlon.<br> <br> He is single and lives in Boston.

Go out and get what you want! Don't complain about it and do nothing and expect it to happen. I also hate when people cut me off while I'm talking. Please let me finish what I have to say, it may be important.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>What's your personal claim to fame?</strong> I am extremely proud of making our S.W.A.T. team. I had to work extremely hard to lose a ton of weight to be physically able to even try out, much less do well enough to make the team. I was one of the youngest and least experienced people to ever make our S.W.A.T. team.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Who or what is your inspiration in life?</strong> My hero is my stepfather, Tim. Tim met my mother shortly after my parents separated. My whole life he has always been a steady father figure and an amazing role model. He taught me the value of hard work and how to be a humble man. When I met Tim at seven years old, he had nothing. My mother and him worked diligently and started a company from nothing and now want for nothing. Don't get me wrong, they aren't billionaires, but they pretty much do what they want when they want. Tim works many long hours and long nights to provide an amazing life to our family. The best part about him is you will never hear him brag about it. There is a song written by Brad Paisley that makes me think of him and brings tears to my eyes when I hear it. It's called \"He Didn't Have to Be.\" It talks about how his stepfather was a great father to him and he hoped that he can be half the dad that he didn't have to be. That describes how I feel about Tim.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>If you could have three things on the island what would they be and why?</strong> A picture of my kids because I will miss them terribly. A Kindle with lots of books for entertainment. A hammock so I can have somewhere comfortable to sleep.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Which&nbsp;<em>Survivor</em>&nbsp;contestant are you most like?&nbsp;</strong> I feel like I can relate to Malcolm from Season 25 the most. I feel like I'm young and athletic like he is and that I could do well in the challenges, making me an asset to my team in the beginning. I also feel like I can play the game strategically like he did, helping me run deep in the game. I work in a profession that requires me to be able to talk to any type of person through all walks of life and be able to relate and convince them to do things that I may need them to do. Malcolm was such a likeable person that he was voted off because three other contestants knew they wouldn't beat him in the final vote. I feel like I'm a very likeable person. I am able to make friends and relate to people anywhere I go.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>What's your reason for being on&nbsp;<em>Survivor</em>?</strong> My primary motivation for being on the show is to win. A million dollars would be a great way for me to provide a great life for my children that I wouldn't be able to do otherwise. My secondary motivation is my desire to compete. I love competing and I love winning. I haven't been able to compete at a high level since I played college football and I would love to be able to compete against other gifted men and women.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Why do you think you'll \"survive\"&nbsp;<em>Survivor</em>?&nbsp;</strong> I believe that I could be the winner for multiple reasons. I have a strong desire to win. I always want to win at absolutely everything I do. Whether it be checkers with my girls or just trying to be the first one to a call for service at work. I always want to be first.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <div class=\"flex-video\"><iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FSurvivor%2Fvideos%2F2184424421826884%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=476\" width=\"476\" height=\"476\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe></div>", "season": 37, "genderData": { "gender": "male", "confidence": 0.9901960784313726 } }, { "name": "Dana Lambert", "banner": "https://www.truedorktimes.com/survivor/cast/images/dana-lambert-bd3.jpg", "bio": "<p><strong>Excerpts from her CBS.com <em>Survivor: Philippines</em></strong> <a href=\"http://www.cbs.com/shows/survivor/cast/159992/\">bio page</a>:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>\"<strong>Personal Claim to Fame:</strong>&nbsp;Truthfully, I have no claim to fame.

That’s real.</p> <p>• <strong>Hobbies:</strong> Gaining knowledge, fishing and working out. </p> <p>• <strong>Pet Peeves:</strong> People who talk too much and habitual liars.</p><p>• <strong>3 Words to Describe You:</strong> Confident, anomaly and rebellious.</p> <p>• <strong>If You Could Have 3 Things on the Island What Would They Be and Why?</strong> Sunglasses so I can hide from the ugly contestants; iPod, so I can tune the haters out; pack of cigarettes.</p> <p>• <em><strong>Survivor</strong></em><strong> Contestant You Are Most Like:</strong> <em>Survivor</em> is all about evaluating your circumstances. I can say I want to play the game like B Rob, Sean Rector, or Tony and be in control the whole time. One thing I would want to do is be likable, be the JT then cut their throats one by one while they don’t see me. I just have to keep others fighting and I will be fine.</p> <p>• <strong>Reason for Being on <em>Survivor</em>:</strong> I want to prove to the world that I can win and be successful in life despite my past. I want to encourage other people who think they’re useless and do something worth value. I also want to become the best survivor ever! I want to be forever remembered as the ultimate Survivor!</p> <p>• <strong>Why You Think You’ll “Survive”<em> Survivor</em></strong>: I have been all around the country, love the outdoors and love to fish. I know CPR first aid because I was a lifeguard. My social game will always be up to par and I am an extremely hard worker.</p> <p>• <strong>Why You Think You Will Be the Sole Survivor:</strong> I have been through adversities. I know how it feels to fail. But I also know how to win. Using negative energy to dig deep and win, that’s the mind you have to have coming into this game. I am a hard worker and a great team player. I have done a little of everything and I can say I have a well-rounded skill set. I have a lot to prove, in my eyes, and I won’t let anyone stop me from winning!\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\"flex-video\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mts7aQmP-mw?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div>", "season": 32, "genderData": { "gender": "male", "confidence": 0.9090909090909092 } }, { "name": "Dave Cruser", "banner": "https://www.truedorktimes.com/survivor/cast/images/dave-cruser-bd3.jpg", "bio": "<p>From his official CBS <em>Survivor: China</em> <a href=\"http://www.cbs.com/shows/survivor/cast/20278/\">bio page</a>:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>\"Dave Cruser is currently a bartender.

Never expect a free ride with me if I see you being complacent. I will push you to get up and show initiative. There's nothing that bothers me more than a lazy person who acts privileged around those who've had to work for things their entire life. Oh, and calling me Dave or David instead of&nbsp;<em>Davie</em>, my momma named me that!</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>What's your personal claim to fame?</strong> My online presence. I've always prided myself on my social media presence via various platforms. I wear my pages on my sleeve so to say that anything a person wants to know about me they can find on my multiple accounts. I've been proclaimed \"the social media guru\" among my closest friends because I know every trick and trinket to the game. Examples: Posting at peak hours to maximize the amount of \"likes\" you receive, guaranteed responses from females via Direct Messages (how to slide into them DMs), not to mention providing Grade A entertainment via video stories regularly.&nbsp;I've often also been told that my Instagram/Twitter/Facebook is \"my favorite\" from friends and even been called by my Instagram handle in public quite frequently (@iHateDavie) by strangers. Social media is also the reason I became employed with the top agency in the world for Public Health. I can say with confidence that it is my expertise and claim to fame undeniably.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>If you could have three things on the island what would they be and why?&nbsp;</strong> My harmonica. I believe in therapy and relaxation and making my own music will do just that. When I am stressed in the game, I can create this escape mentally and physically and maybe even look for idols in the process or entertain a few people and make friends along the way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p>My Davy Crockett hat. It's my lucky hat. I have worn it to tests and passed and I have worn it on dates and gotten lucky. When I wear this hat, I channel my best self.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>My Bible. I believe that Christ strengthens my being and it's important that I review his teachings, especially in times of chaos and struggle.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Which&nbsp;<em>Survivor</em>&nbsp;contestant are you most like?&nbsp;</strong> Jeremy Collins. He was genuinely a good guy that knew when to speak and knew when to observe, that's my Obama! Also, Tony Vlachos, in that he was an innovative thinker to the game. Finally, Adam Klein in that he's a family man with a giddy sense of humor. They are all winners and so am I!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>What's your reason for being on&nbsp;<em>Survivor</em>?</strong> I want to prove to myself that I can do this. I was always teased for not playing popular sports like my friends so this would be my ultimate competition. I'm the middle child so almost the black sheep of the family. Both of my brothers are so accomplished so I want to have my own unique medal of self-accomplishment. My secondary motivation is my pack, my huskies. Recently, my beta wolf Luna Moon was hit by a car. I thought she was dead but we were able to save her. However, not without me being in debt. With my winnings, I want to create an insurance company for pet owners so that when things like this happen to us, we won't be faced with the hardest decision of our lives (putting a pet down).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Why do you think you'll \"survive\"&nbsp;<em>Survivor</em>?</strong> I understand how packs work. As a Siberian husky breeder, I know that in order to gain the trust of my pups, I have to feed them. I'm a skilled fisherman so as soon as I can get in the water to catch fish for my tribe, I will earn their trust. I also build doghouses and construct kennels for my pups and with my tribe, this would be no different. Creating new innovative, comforting types of shelter will show me as an asset. Lastly, with my pack, I have to be stern with them. I will mingle with the entire tribe, not just a few to show my sociability while also being assertive with them when it's time to put my foot down.\"</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div class=\"flex-video\"><iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FSurvivor%2Fvideos%2F490956064702088%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=476\" width=\"476\" height=\"476\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe></div>", "season": 37, "genderData": { "gender": "unknown", "confidence": null } }, { "name": "Dawn Meehan", "banner": "https://www.truedorktimes.com/survivor/cast/images/dawn-meehan-bd3.jpg", "bio": "<p><span class=\"bodytext\">From her <a href=\"http://movies.msn.com/photos/newest_celeb_photos/?photoidx=100\">MSN.com</a> contestant profile:</span> (8/26/11)</p> <p>\"<strong>Dawn says: </strong>I changed so much because I had gotten cut (twice before) from <em>Survivor</em>.

She is one of the few super humans to walk the Earth.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?</strong> A picture of a skeleton in a grave to constantly remind me that things could be worse, a photo book of my family because I will always love them and they forever motivate me and finally, text message threads between me and my best friend.

I would have a story for the books—the girl that went from village to Versailles. I've seen it all, from the slums to the fast-paced, hard working student life in NYC.

Before her birth I was very overweight, smoked cigarettes, dabbled quite a bit at the craps table and would most likely be sitting down at the poker table on any given day. I recall a specific moment when my daughter was about a year old and she wanted me to take her outside on the swings. It was chilly that day so I had to dress warm. While putting on my shoes, I recall panting from being out of breath from the simple act of tying my own shoes.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>It was at that moment that I knew I had to make a change so that I would be around a long time for her and my other children that were soon to come. In the last seven years, I quit smoking, dropped 65 pounds and even though I can still occasionally be found in a poker room, I have dramatically prioritized where my income goes and where most of my money is spent, which is primarily bills and workout clothes for my wife.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?</strong> A photo of my wife, a picture of my rugrats because they're awesome, and an antihistamine, which I will spike in somebody's drinking water if they are relentlessly annoying me and/or the group on the island.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Which&nbsp;<em>Survivor</em>&nbsp;contestant are you most like?</strong> I know you are looking for one, but I am going to split this in three. Mostly Cirie, because I think she is masterfully empathetic with other players. She has an amazing ability to disable people. I hope I can do what she has done in the game. Second is Cochran. He wins in the emotional intelligence category that allows him to morph into whatever he needs to at the time. He also understands the importance of stroking other people's egos when he needs to. This is something I hope I am capable of doing. And finally Rob Mariano, for the simple fact that we both come from Italian families with a background in construction.

It is D-O-N-A-T-H-A-N, not Jonathan or Donovan.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>What's your personal claim to fame?</strong> I was a part of a national and state level winning dance team. I danced in the hip-hop routine. I am proud of being openly gay and dancing in front of thousands in this area. My goal is always to try to change the opinions of others when it comes to the LGBTQ community and through dancing, I was able to open the arms of many.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p>There will never be another me when it comes to those years and for that impact, I feel very accomplished. Being the only guy to hold a national championship among the basketball, football and baseball guys—yeah, that felt really nice!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Who or what is your inspiration in life?</strong> My hero is my grandmother, Deloris Bentley. Always has been, always will be. My grandmother had seven children between the years of 1960-1968, with my mom being the youngest. She raised them all with very limited food, no power until 1975, no bathrooms, only outhouses—all while dealing with the day-to-day struggles of having an alcoholic as a husband.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Over the years, things got better for her. She raised her children, divorced and re-married (twice), and ended up being very independent and open-minded! In 2006, she had a brain aneurysm. She flew out to have emergency surgery and you know what saved her that time? Her blood was so thick from smoking three packs a day for so many years, that the aneurysm was sealed shut.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>After her surgery, she was up the next morning eating on some ice. Now if that isn't inspiring, I don't know what is! She has always been the glue in our family. She is such a hero in my eyes because of all the sacrifices, determination and selflessness she has expressed and shown all her life! Many people are probably picking celebrities and all that jazz, but my little 'ole Maw Maw is my hero.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Which&nbsp;<em>Survivor</em>&nbsp;contestant are you most like?</strong> While there are tons of castaways that I have related to, especially those from the LGBTQ community (Colton, Todd, Tai), and my hillbillies (Keith, Sandy, JT), I always find the most relatable to be Cirie.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p>No one expected the gameplay Cirie played in her first season. She went out there, hated leaves, and really didn't know much about the game. But you know what? She went out there and learned the way.

I didn't quit through my season of depression. Just kept putting one foot in front of the other. Didn't rely on feelings, but logic. I defend people and injustices. People talk to me because I am trustworthy. I have watched enough of the game to know how it is played, but not so fanatic about it that I am a geek. I just LOVE the show.

He continued playing football in high school and began running track. Huffman's hopes of being a potential college football prospect were shattered when he broke his leg during his senior year. In track, he specialized in the Triple Jump, qualifying and competing once for the State Championship.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Huffman graduated from Furman University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Business Administration in 2003. In 2001, he also spent six months studying at Griffith University in Queensland, Australia. During college, he played intramural sports, but his energy became more focused on music. Having previously worked as a sporting goods sales representative and a waiter, Huffman found more pleasure in media and entertainment. At age 18, he began modeling and landed spots in local print ads and commercials in Greenville. His profile took a leap when he was discovered by Ford Models. He has done work with Hanes, Glamour, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, Finish Line (in Sports Illustrated), Macy's, Target and many others.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Huffman's father began teaching him guitar at age 13, and he later picked up bass guitar at age 16.

During his free time at Furman, Huffman began playing bass guitar with Alex Florez, and just before graduating college, he decided to pursue music more seriously. He is currently a full-time musician, playing bass guitar and singing with his rock band, FLOREZ. The band travels in a 15-passenger van to various cities across the United States, playing about three shows a week at clubs, colleges and private parties. FLOREZ has shared the stage with Sister Hazel, Better Than Ezra, Josh Kelley, The Doobie Brothers, Gavin DeGraw and Robert Randolph, to name a few. In 2005, the band signed a co-publishing deal with BMG Songs North America and, in February of 2006, their song, \"Natalie,\" was featured in the television series \"Scrubs.\" Aside from music, Erik still models part-time.

Surf and socks and pale white, wasn’t the look I wanted to go with. So I’m going to be finding as many trees to sit under on the island as I can!”&nbsp;<br> <br> Fighting for the win, Fenella says she wants to give back to her parents by shouting them a trip overseas, a new flute for her sister and enough for her and her husband to buy a home.&nbsp;But Fenella knows that winning isn’t going to be easy, especially considering some of her biggest weaknesses.&nbsp;<br> <br> “I can’t keep secrets! I’m terrible at lying. I’m also really fiery and awkward in social scenarios if I’m nervous and I have the worst memory.

She credits her acting coach, Manu Tupou, with whom she has been studying with for four years, for pushing her beyond her own limitations and encouraging her to write and direct, as well. Her biggest accomplishment was a play that she and her best friend wrote, directed and produced, titled Beautiful Chaos, for the Hudson Theater in Los Angeles. Additionally, she has had roles in various independent films, commercials, and feature films,&nbsp;including the telefilm That Championship Season.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>As Manthey puts it, she grew up an 'army brat'; her father served 28 years in the United States Army, having retired in 1997. Due to the military way of life, she moved every three to four years of her childhood, spending a total of 12 years on various Army bases in Germany. Graduating from high school in 1988 in Neu Ulm, she then attended the University of Maryland in Munich, Germany.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Manthey describes herself as adventurous, fun loving, spontaneous, honest, and kind. Her favorite hobbies include photography, cooking, painting, writing, reading, and her all-time favorite, camping. She enjoys hiking and/or backpacking to very remote, unknown places in order to escape the craziness of Los Angeles. Her favorite event is Burning Man, a festival that takes place every year in the vast, barren Black Rock desert of Nevada. She has gone for the last two years and says she will go every year for as long as she lives or until the event no longer takes place. At Burning Man 2000, she and a group of friends from all over California organized a theme camp and stayed for 12 days. They built their own shelter and brought all the supplies necessary to survive in the harsh environment and extreme weather. Manthey named their temporary residence 'Camp Chaos' and adopted the slogan 'The Ultimate Order Lies in Chaos,' a motto she believes applies directly to her life.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>A perfect day for Manthey always begins with a cup of coffee! Then, a hike in one of the various canyons of Los Angeles, playing with her dog Gidget and her cat Kiya, writing in her journal, surfing the net, e-mailing, watching a good movie, spending time with a close friend over dinner, and curling up with a good book. Her favorite movies are <em>The Big Lebowski </em>and <em>Search for the Holy Grail</em>. Her favorite TV shows are <em>The Sopranos</em> and <em>Sex and the City</em>. She enjoys all types of music-depending on her mood- ranging from Al Green and Barry White to Creed and Tonic. When she's ready to dance, she enjoys funky, soulful, house music.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Manthey was born in Bad Konstatt Hospital on the Army base in Stuttgart, Germany. She is proud to report that her mother and father--both from South Dakota--are still together and happily married. She has two brothers and one sister. Her birth date is September 5, 1970.\"</p>", "season": 2, "genderData": { "gender": "female", "confidence": 0.96 } }, { "name": "Jerry Sims", "banner": "https://www.truedorktimes.com/survivor/cast/images/jerry-sims-bd3.jpg", "bio": "<p>From his official CBS <em>Survivor: Tocantins</em> cast <a href=\"http://www.cbs.com/shows/survivor/cast/23297/\">bio page</a>:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div class=\"flex-video\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tAgYJXt6Tl4?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div> <br class=\"clearfloat\"> <p>\"Jerry Sims promises, \"you've never seen anybody like me before.\" Growing up in a poor family, he was one of 10 children who had to learn, very early on, the skills to help him survive in the real world.

In college, I played indoor volleyball at Northern Arizona University. After four years of being self-coached and self-funded, we upset the number one team in the nation in the finals of a Vegas tournament.<br> <strong>Inspiration in Life:</strong>&nbsp;My Dad. My whole life, he was incredibly hard on me and always pushing me to become better at everything I did. He grew up very poor and in a large family in which he endured a lot of hardships.

In terms of game play, I would have to say it’s a combination of Malcolm and Ozzy.<br> <strong>Reason for Being on <em>Survivor</em>:</strong>&nbsp;Ever since I can remember I have wanted to be on <em>Survivor</em>. My primary motivation is that every day I dream about competing and earning the title of sole Survivor. With every season, my desire to play has grown more and more. The game is a true test of self-awareness as well as mental, physical and emotional determination. There is also a perk of a million dollars. I would honestly play <em>Survivor</em> for way less but the fact that it is one million dollars makes it that much sweeter.<br> <strong>Why You’ll “Survive” <em>Survivor</em>:</strong>&nbsp;I would be an asset to the tribe because I am athletic and very competitive. I love competition and I hate losing. I am not lazy and I don’t mind doing what needs to get done in order to help others. I feel that I’m in decent physical shape, but I will work hard and will bust my butt in challenges and around camp. I have worked in different jobs that have focused on customer service and have dealt with a wide range of diversity in the workplace. This has taught me how to communicate and connect with people I don’t know. I’m a very social person and I enjoy getting to know people and their story. Being one of the most important aspects of <em>Survivor</em>, I feel my social game will be strong and lead to my success in the game<br> <strong>Why Will You Be the Sole Survivor:</strong>&nbsp;With every season I watch, I can’t help but imagine that I'm actually in the game playing. My brain goes into game/strategy mode as I put myself in the shoes of the current contestants and analyze how I would deal with the conflicts each is faced with. Of course, it’s different when you’re sitting at home on the couch and know what every player is thinking. However, I feel that I am well rounded enough, athletic enough and mentally strong enough to adapt to the people I’m put with. I am confident in the life skills I possess and I feel I can maintain my focus despite all of the other personal and crazy things the game may and will throw my way. After being such a huge fan for so many years, I truly respect how complex and challenging the game is.

I used to do a newsletter in high school and wear a buff around my arm every Thursday, now it would be Wednesday. My senior yearbook picture was me wearing three buffs, two around my arm and one around my forehead, and a Survivor T-shirt. This has been ingrained in me for 11 years.

It was one of the few times in my life where my personal interests and academic obligations coincided perfectly.<br> <strong>Hobbies:</strong> Guitar, trivia and studying the music and history of The Beatles.<br> <strong>Pet peeves:</strong> People who think or act like they are smarter than they actually are and people who don't have a sense of humor.<br> <strong>3 words to describe you: </strong>Neurotic, insecure and brilliant.<br> <em><strong>Survivor</strong></em><strong> contestant you are most like: </strong>I have some of the humor of Rob Cesternino, the candor of Jonathan Penner and the intelligence of Yul Kwon. <br> <strong>Reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>: </strong>My respect and admiration for <em>Survivor</em> and my desire to make it even better. My secondary motivation is to experience some adventure and excitement in my life during a time when I otherwise feel like I'm on autopilot. <br> <strong>Why you think you'll 'survive' <em>Survivor</em>: </strong>I have a strong sense of humor that can defuse tense situations and an ability to listen to conflicting viewpoints and devise a rational compromise that is satisfying to all parties involved. I also have a slender frame that doesn't take up much space in a crowded shelter. <br> <strong>Why you think you will be the sole Survivor:</strong> I understand other people and how they function. Sure, I'm bright and have an extensive knowledge of <em>Survivor</em>, but none of that does any good unless you're able to figure out the reasons why other people do the things they do. Not only can I do that, but I'm also confident that I can leverage their desires and motives in a way that best serves my game.\"</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div class=\"flex-video\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/-ZyIhVIxYn4?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div>", "season": 23, "genderData": { "gender": "male", "confidence": 0.9963448065793482 } }, { "name": "John Cody", "banner": "https://www.truedorktimes.com/survivor/cast/images/john-cody-bd3.jpg", "bio": "<p>From his (and Candice's) pre-game interview with EW's <a href=\"http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20302134_20726344_30006482,00.html\">Dalton Ross</a>:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>\"The former Candice Woodcock is back for a third go round (after&nbsp;<em>Cook Islands</em>&nbsp;and<em> Heroes vs. Villains</em>) and says she has no problem voting her husband off — under the right circumstances.

I currently consistently work for over 20 different wrestling promotions all over the world. Two years ago, I came to Triple A without speaking fluent Spanish and sat in a locker room full of prideful luchadores, some of whom had worked for that company for over 20 years. Less than one year later, I'm the first non-Mexican Triple Champion of Triple A because I positioned myself strategically within that organization, built a great relationship with the owner, and by kicking ass, like I kick ass in the ring my talent could not be overlooked. I am an English speaking Irish-American who grew up in Palos Verdes, and a multi-million dollar Mexican wrestling company decided that I am the best person to represent their brand.

Now in remission, Josh said applying for season two felt like giving cancer a big middle finger. Why should anyone let such a nasty disease control and dictate their life?&nbsp;Josh has made it very clear – he isn’t here for the money, his competitive nature only wants one thing - the title of Sole Survivor.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>What's your personal claim to fame?&nbsp;</strong>I have a world famous man cave. Talk to anyone from Taranaki and they will have heard or been to a ‘party’ in my man cave!&nbsp;It has an array of sporting memorabilia, general man cave stuff and all the games tables to keep everyone entertained.&nbsp;It has be featured on Crowd Goes Wild, All Blacks TV and won several prizes! Plus, some of NZ’s greatest sporting trophies have graced the man cave as well.&nbsp;I also love tornadoes and storms, and I plan on going storm chasing in America later this year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>What did you do to prepare for&nbsp;<strong><em>Survivor</em><strong>? </strong></strong></strong>I binge watched a lot of&nbsp;<em>Survivor</em>! I haven’t watched a huge amount in recent years so caught up on past New Zealand and Australian series.&nbsp;I also learnt how to make a fire from flint and kindling – a crucial <em>Survivor</em> skill to have! I practiced memory games and puzzles after physically exerting myself, in an attempt to mimic the game situations.&nbsp;Physically, my fitness was at a solid peak before going over to Thailand. I was in the middle of triathlon training so I continued that.&nbsp;I also went cold turkey on coffee three weeks before we flew out! There was to be no three coffees a day on the island. Fair to say going cold turkey isn’t easy! Otherwise, I settled on the party shirts I wanted to take onto the island and tried to stay injury free.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Why do you think you should win&nbsp;<strong><em>Survivor</em><strong>? </strong></strong></strong><em>Survivor</em>&nbsp;should be won by someone that really plays the game, like it is globally – I want to win it that way. I have strengths across all three aspects of the game – social, physical, and strategic – which are vital building blocks to becoming the Sole Survivor. However I will need to manage my efforts as I do not want to become a huge threat early on. Endurance is the single most important factor in the pursuit of anything in life, and <em>Survivor </em>is no different. I believe through my life experiences and sheer determination and resilience to win and succeed, I have the endurance required to win this game. If it requires me to go on an Immunity Challenge winning run then so be it. Lastly, I am a survivor already. I know what it takes to survive a life threatening situation.&nbsp; I am not going out there for the prize money, I am going there for the title of Sole Survivor. I am here to play and win that title.

I'm also working on my BS at University of Central Florida. <br> <strong>Inspiration in Life:</strong> I am not the average girl who has a normal hero. Essentially, if I were normal I would either choose Abraham Lincoln or Donald Trump, but my hero is fiction. Her name is Xena. She is the warrior princess, who serves as my alter ego.

I have always taken the \"leader role\" with my friends, family and co-workers. I build relationships, talk my way out of tickets, and socialize my way to the top. My skill set is very strong and it comes to me naturally, like breathing. I definitely think I will be an important member of the group. <br> <strong>Why You Think You Will Be the Sole Survivor</strong>: My life has already played this game and I won. I have faced life and death situations at a very young age. I'm a fighter and I'll never quit. I'm very good at getting my way, talking people into things and ultimately marketing and selling myself. I may be a 22-year-old blonde but I'm much tougher than I look.

During 1993, Famie began&nbsp;appearing in cooking segments called 'Famie's Adventures in Cooking' for local Detroit television stations. The popular segments ultimately led to several half-hour specials airing in Detroit. In 1996 Famie opened Forte and was selected yet again in Esquire's yearly 'Best New Restaurants' — this time in 1997. Last year, he produced and hosted his first one-hour prime time Emmy-nominated special, <em>From Hanoi to China Beach a Taste of the Exotic</em>, a documentary that was based on a journey through Vietnam with three Vietnam veterans on bicycles. Before it aired in Detroit, the special previewed at the local Fox Theater. This spring his cookbook, <em>Famie's Adventures in Cooking</em>, will be published by Sleeping Bear Press.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Famie is a divorced father of two children, Josh and Alicia, and describes himself as creative, adventurous, and just happy to be alive each day, or as he puts it 'everyday I wake up is a good Day'. In addition to spending time with his kids, Famie enjoys biking, weight lifting, scuba diving, dirt bike riding, wall climbing, herb gardening, touring unusual markets, collecting art, tennis and hiking in the mountains.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Famie was recently voted President of the Rainbow Connection after a two-year stint as Vice President. The Rainbow Connection is a non-profit organization that helps grant wishes for children with life threatening illnesses in Michigan.

Jenna because of her strategy to flirt to the finish. She wasn't afraid of much and used her strengths like beauty, social and brains to get her to the top. Kim because of her ability to keep cool when necessary and her athletic ability was on point. Natalie, because she used her southern outgoing charm to win hearts and keep her social game strong.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Why do you think you'll \"survive\"&nbsp;<em>Survivor</em>?</strong> Because I know that I can outlast and outplay! I work out a lot. I have endurance, I danced for 12 years. I have balance. I've completed tough mudders, marathons, and other races so I can get myself through challenges. My social game is strong. Making friends and alliances wouldn't be an issue for me. Though I now work with technology and digital media, I grew up camping, hunting, and fishing. I love the outdoors so I know I can use that experience and those skills to outlast those 39 days. I'm strong, smart, and pretty and I know how to use it.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <div class=\"flex-video\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tAnwGMFhEt8?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div>", "season": 36, "genderData": { "gender": "female", "confidence": 0.9411764705882353 } }, { "name": "Linda Spencer", "banner": "https://www.truedorktimes.com/survivor/cast/images/linda-spencer-bd3.jpg", "bio": "<p>From her official CBS <em>Survivor: Africa</em> cast <a href=\"http://www.cbs.com/shows/survivor/cast/20809/\">bio page</a>:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>\"Linda Spencer is currently an Assistant Director of Career Services at Harvard University, as well as a married mother of two children.

If there is a potential obstacle in her path, it might be her fear of extreme heights, but she is willing to parachute out of a plane if it will earn her $1 million.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Morales' favorite past Survivor is Rupert because on the show he was hard-working, friendly, disliked conflict and was eager to gather food and cook for all. Her hero is Oprah Winfrey, whom she considers a truly wonderful, giving person who cares about people. She enjoys cooking, traveling, reading, collecting books and watching foreign movies.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Morales currently resides in Lakewood, Washington.

In addition to killing her fellow castaways with kindness, she has every intention of pulling her own weight around camp while studying their words and actions meticulously to “learn about her enemies before she chooses her weapon.” Confident that she can win the title of Sole Survivor, Monica plans to buy a designer purse as her first selfish purchase. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Monica resides in San Diego, Calif. and her birthday is July 14th.\"</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\"flex-video\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1dAhd31py3Q?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div>", "season": 19, "genderData": { "gender": "female", "confidence": 0.996996996996997 } }, { "name": "Monika Radulovic", "banner": "https://www.truedorktimes.com/survivor/cast/images/monika-radulovic-bd3.jpg", "bio": "<p> Excerpts from Monika's <a href=\"https://tenplay.com.au/channel-ten/australian-survivor/survivors/monika\">official bio page</a> (7/31/18):</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>\"Monika may be one of Australia’s most beautiful models but she’s very keen to prove there’s more to her than how she looks.&nbsp;<br> <br> Crowned Miss Australia in 2015 and third in Miss Universe, Monika also studied psychology at University and is planning to use that to her advantage saying, “People probably think I’d just be a beauty because of what I do, but I have brains too and I can’t wait to show everyone!”&nbsp;<br> <br> Recently married and heading to&nbsp;<em>Survivor&nbsp;</em>as a newlywed, Monika thinks the hardest part for her will be missing her family.

They are so brave and I think their resilience and positive outlook on life will help me through the tough times on the island.”&nbsp;<br> <br> Stepping out of her comfort zone, Monika was initially terrified of competing and roughing it.

I can also relate to Natalie Tenerelli because she was a young contestant and also a dancer.</p> <p><strong>Reason for Being on <em>Survivor</em>:</strong>&nbsp;The chance to experience a once in a lifetime journey and to show everyone that just because I have huge boobs and a pretty face does not mean I am dumb, it just means I look better when I am winning.</p> <p><strong>Why You Think You’ll “Survive”<em> Survivor</em>:</strong>&nbsp;I have great leadership skills when working in a group.

I am the daughter of a contractor, so he taught me well.</p> <p><strong>Do You Consider Yourself a Brain, a Beauty or a Brawn?</strong>&nbsp;I consider myself all three but if I have to pick, I would pick Beauty.

It is the first thing I look at when I talk to people and sometimes it looks like a person hasn't brushed their teeth in days. What is that life?

It wasn't until recently when I saw Jeff at a&nbsp;<em>Survivor</em>&nbsp;event that the opportunity seemed realistic.

I couldn't afford employees, so I did everything myself at first. I opened another shop, then another and then built a factory in 2010 to start selling pints to grocery stores, and have since opened a second factory. We're now sold in grocery stores in all 50 states, have a team of around 100 and sales this year that will be about 100 times sales from the first year, despite almost going broke during the economic downturn and unrelenting competition. I am proud of the growth, taking on the challenges, being creative, treating employees well, giving a great deal back and inspiring others through my version of the American dream.</p> <p><strong>Inspiration in Life:</strong> I am not much for heroes, but the person who has come closest to obtaining hero status is my Uncle Larry. I admire him for the deep and devoted love that he had for my aunt. Despite being a tough guy, he has never been afraid to cry or share his feelings. I admire him for his larger-than-life deeds, like finding 55 pounds of cocaine off the coast of Florida (he’s a former cop and turned it in). I admired him because of his Popeye-like muscle on his forearm, which I later found out is actually a tumor, but I didn’t know that as a kid. But more than anything, I have always admired him for being himself.</p> <p><strong>Hobbies:</strong> Traveling, indoor rock climbing and one-upmanship.</p> <p><strong>Pet Peeves:</strong> I am not really one to complain and therefore don’t have too many pet peeves but I do have very little patience for whiny people and hypocritical bible thumpers.</p> <p><strong>3 Words to Describe You:</strong> Incorrigible, witty and kind.</p> <p><strong>If You Could Have 3 Things on the Island What Would They Be and Why?</strong> I would take a big comfortable bed with high thread count sheets, a down comforter and lush pillows to facilitate good nights’ sleep and an assortment of fake immunity idols and fake printed clues on convincing paper to fool my fellow contestants into thinking that they have immunity. Lastly, a spy kit so that I can bug camp and listen in on the plotting and scheming of my campmates to give me valuable information.</p> <p><em><strong>Survivor</strong></em><strong> Contestant You Are Most Like:</strong> I relate to Erik Reichenbach as my brother in ice cream. I can relate to Rob Mariano because he not only won but he seemed to have more fun than anyone else while doing so. I can relate to Tyson for his priceless, witty commentary on the other players. I relate to Parvarti because I think that I’ll also charm my fellow competitors while I’m busy destroying them. I kind of hate myself for saying this, but I relate to Russell Hantz for his lack of fear and filter.</p> <p><strong>Reason for Being on <em>Survivor:</em> </strong>My primary reason is to win, as is my secondary reason. Winning the money will be amazing but I am more interested in the metaphorical crown, bragging rights and satisfaction that comes with winning than the cash. It is also to have the privilege to compete in what I consider one of the greatest competitions of all. I have watched the show for years and yearn for the chance to be a castaway in a remote locale and compete for 39 days.</p> <p><strong>Why You Think You’ll “Survive”<em> Survivor</em>:</strong> I will be the provider for the group and the court jester. I will be a calming force and the one that psyches up the tribe to go into battle. I am a strong swimmer and will be a valuable hunter, fisher and gatherer for the group. I have a tireless work ethic and will contribute more than my fair share towards building a strong shelter, cooking and getting water. I am most often happy, quite witty, never complain and am generally entertaining, which will help to keep the peace during tough and stressful times. I am physically and mentally strong, I was a competitive athlete for years, I am a fast runner and sharp, so I will be strong in challenges.</p> <p><strong>Why You Think You Will Be the Sole Survivor:</strong> I have been a <em>Survivor</em> fan for years and therefore understand the game, am mentally tough, a physical force, likable and absolutely determined to win. I will excel at both the social and physical game. Much of my life has prepared me to be a great contestant. Being a fan has shown me some brilliant moves and perhaps more importantly, stupid ones to avoid. More than anything, I believe that I will be the sole Survivor because I want to and I usually get what I want, no matter how hard I have to work for it.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\"flex-video\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tB3oA3jW70A?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div>", "season": 32, "genderData": { "gender": "male", "confidence": 0.9866666666666667 } }, { "name": "Nick Brown", "banner": "https://www.truedorktimes.com/survivor/cast/images/nick-brown-bd3.jpg", "bio": "<p>From his official CBS <em>Survivor: The Australian Outback</em> cast <a href=\"http://www.cbs.com/shows/survivor/cast/20789/\">bio page</a>:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>\"Nick Brown is entering his second year at Harvard Law School and hopes to join the Army's Judge Advocate General's office upon graduation.

In 1951, six years after Scout and Raider training at Fort Pierce, Florida, Rudy completed UDT (Underwater Demolition Teams) training in Little Creek, Virginia, and was assigned to UDT-2 (redesignated as UDT-21 in 1953). He remained in UDT-21 for the next 11 years. During this period, he completed numerous specialized schools and deployed routinely to the Mediterranean and Caribbean areas with the&nbsp;Naval Amphibious Forces. Rudy became a proficient combat swimmer and expert in small-boat operations. In 1962, Rudy was one of the 50 hand-selected officers of the original SEAL (Sea-Air-Land) Team TWO, becoming one of their most distinguished members.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In 1967, Rudy was advanced to the rank of Master Chief Petty Officer and, between combat tours, served as the senior enlisted position of Command Master Chief. From 1968-1970, Rudy completed two combat deployments to Vietnam. Among his numerous awards, Rudy earned the Bronze Star Medal for heroic action during more than 45 combat operations. During and after his stint in Vietnam, Rudy was delegated the \"Chief SEAL,\" and set physical and operational standards at SEAL Team TWO.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In the late 1980's, Rudy became the Naval Special Warfare Community \"Bull Frog,\" a distinguishing award presented to the SEAL serving the longest time on active duty. Instead of retiring, Rudy was selected as the Senior Enlisted Advisor to USSOCOM. In August of 1988, Rudy headed to Tampa, Florida and entered into the \"inner circle\" of the Special Operations Command to advise on all enlisted matters of the Joint command. For his extraordinary performance, Rudy was awarded the Defense Superior Service Medal - an award not often given to an enlisted man.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Master Chief Rudy retired from the U.S. Navy after completing over 45 years continuous activity. He was honorably discharged on August 1, 1990. Rudy and Marge, his wife of 42 years, are now involved in extensive volunteer work. In 1992, Rudy captained a 38' power boat during the Americas Cup 1992 event. In 1996, he captained a support boat at the Summer Olympic Games. He continues as a Red Cross Volunteer and drives support vehicles and performs essential services during disaster-relief operations. He is also a volunteer for the Virginia Beach Police Department. Involved with many organizations, Rudy is a founding member of the UDT-SEAL Association and a founding member of the Association's Board of Directors, having once served as their President. He is also on the Board of Directors of the Special Operations Fund.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Rudy currently lives in Virginia Beach, Virginia.

The American Flag – perhaps my biggest source of pride is being an American; and The Economist – This is my preferred news source (despite the fact that it’s perceived as “snobbish”).<br> <strong><em>Survivor</em> Contestant You Are Most Like:</strong>&nbsp;The cleverness and strategic planning of Stephen, but the personality of Marty. Like Marty, I am a natural leader and can come off as pompous or bombastic. Also, I shared Marty’s disdain for Jane on <em>S21</em>.<br> <strong>Reason for Being on <em>Survivor</em>:</strong>&nbsp;The competition. I’m insanely competitive in chess, pursuing a career in investment banking, and everything I do. I want to play the game of <em>Survivor</em> for the challenge, the competition and the chance to prove myself in such an epic game, under such trying circumstances. Also, the money. The expected value of playing <em>Survivor </em>is, monetarily alone, worth more than most peoples’ salaries. I love $1,000,000 almost as much as winning.<br> <strong>Why You Think You’ll “Survive”<em> Survivor</em>:</strong>&nbsp;I’m a strong leader despite my young age, and have worked well in a team in a number of different academic, athletic and chess-related capacities. I’m also extremely competitive and would be a large asset to a tribe in puzzles and endurance-related challenges, as well as strategic competitions.<br> <strong>Why You Think You Will Be the Sole Survivor:&nbsp;</strong>I’m the chess expert who can plan my victory 10 moves in advance. I can use economic game theory to know the incentives of those around me. I’m the only guy who has these skills and is still personable enough to win. Think of me as a John Cochran who doesn’t suck.<br> <strong>Do You Consider Yourself a Brain, a Beauty or a Brawn?&nbsp;</strong>A Brain, in both life and<em> Survivor</em> super fandom. I've seen every episode. I know the game inside and out. I'll know what I'm doing in camp life; I could probably even build a shelter just using rocks. When my body is withered and I'm left with only my t-shirt and tighty whities, I won't be a little boy out there. I'll rely on my mind.<br> <strong>Who Do You Think Has the Best Chance in the Game of <em>Survivor</em>: Brains, Beauty or Brawn?&nbsp;</strong>What type of person excels in <em>Survivor</em>? The person who pushes the game forward strategically - the Rob Cesternino, Yul Kwon or Todd Hertzog [<em>sic.</em>].

He was also Officer of the Deck qualified, which enabled him to run the ship for the Captain on a four-hour watch rotation.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In 1984, Deitz was ordered to the US Navy flight school in Pensacola, Florida, where he learned to fly a Navy T-34 turbo prop. He earned jet grades and was sent to Meridian, Mississippi for T-2 and T-A4 advanced jet training. After he obtained his Navy wings, he was ordered to NAS Miramar in San Diego, California, for training in the F-14 Tomcat. In 1986, he began flying the F-14. In 1987, he was a pilot with the Fighter Squadron-51 (Miramar/Deployed on the USS Carl Vinson CVN-70).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Deitz met his wife, Trish, six days before his last six-month cruise.

In 1992, married life with family aspirations triggered his decision to leave the active duty Navy.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>He was honorably discharged from active Navy and entered Navy reserve. He was then hired by American Airlines as a commercial pilot. In 1994, he and his family moved from San Diego to Simsbury, Connecticut to be able to fly out of New York and Boston. While employed as a commercial pilot, he was also hired by the Naval Reserve Logistics Squadron-52 where he flew the DC-9 worldwide out of the Navy air station in Willow Grove, Pennsylvania. He was later promoted to Commander and eventually retired in April 2001.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Deitz presently resides in Simsbury, Connecticut with Trish and their children, Kayla and Daniel.

As a child, Sampson spent a lot of his time with his grandfather, watching wrestling and <em>The Price is Right</em>. He attended Sullivan Central High School, where he played football all four years. He then attended three years of college at Northeast State Technical Community College in Blountville. He obtained employment at a sales plant and eagerly pursued a career in wrestling on the side. Sampson was granted a tryout match with the National Championship&nbsp;Wrestling (NCW) in Cornelia, Georgia. NCW became the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) when Sampson began doing shows for the World Championship Wrestling and then with World Wrestling Entertainment. He was known to the wrestling community as 'Romeo Bliss.'</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Two years after Sampson was married, he decided to retire from wrestling to make his family his priority. In 2002, Sampson attended Walter State Police Academy, where he received a certificate of basic law enforcement in officer education. He currently lives in Johnson City, Tennessee, with his wife, Jennifer and their four boys, Aaron, 11; Erick, 8; Trevor, 7 and Gabriel, 2 ½.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Sampson currently works in loss prevention at Wal-Mart and also coaches football at the Johnson City Boys and Girls Club. He describes himself as aggressive, persistent and outspoken and enjoys critiquing other people's flaws, showing off when weight training and playing video games. He says his proudest accomplishment is his four sons. His wife is his hero because she went through 38 months of pain to bring them all into this world. He is a member of the NRA, Civil War Historical Society and Police Benevolent Association and is very active with his church.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Travis believes he will bring his leadership, aggressiveness and inventiveness to <em>Survivor: Vanuatu</em>, and his primary reason for participating is to live a life that isn't so ordinary. He believes that he could be the Sole Survivor because he has 'learned how to adapt to different people and different situations.

I have diligently put tapes in when I thought the tape was the right time, and I believe years of manifesting and believing in myself and my girls at ages they are at, that this was the time to prove to not only myself but all the thousands of people I know DREAMS COME TRUE! Trick is you have to make them happen and never lose sight of your dreams. Dream Big!!</p> <p><strong>Why You Think You Will Be the Sole Survivor:&nbsp;</strong>My greatest strength is my intuition and my people skills. I am a chameleon with people and have an ability to read people and situations with great strength. On top of that, I have a lot of charisma and positive energy, and I am likeable, incredibly agile and a good athlete.</p> <p><strong>Do You Consider Yourself a Brain, a Beauty or a Brawn?&nbsp;</strong>I would consider myself a Brawn. I was raised in a home with four very tough brothers who were all incredible hockey players. They used to put me in goal and take slap shots off me from about two feet away when I was in kindergarten. Needless to say, they taught me well. I grew up athletic, tough and confident in the defense of myself and others. My life has been very difficult with many ugly and unpredictable obstacles and I made a conscious choice to never give up on myself or my dreams. I believe it is my God given tenacity and spirit that I was born with that gives me the title: Brawn. As my brother Mark always said so well, I am a TOUGHY TIGER!!</p> <p><strong>Who Do You Think Has the Best Chance in the Game of <em>Survivor</em>: Brains, Beauty or Brawn?&nbsp;</strong>I think that the Brawns will win without question as long as they do not allow their egos to take over. I think common sense in the game of <em>Survivor</em> is essential and often times really smart people lack that. I also think it is one thing to be able to build a spaceship and whole different story when it comes to building a shelter and toughing it out in the woods. Beauty is just beauty. How do you build shelter, fires and boil your own water on your looks? I think a Brawn will win.\"</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div class=\"flex-video\"><iframe width=\"600\" height=\"338\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/G81zCHlpfzY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div>", "season": 28, "genderData": { "gender": "female", "confidence": 0.8571428571428572 } }, { "name": "Troyzan Robertson", "banner": "https://www.truedorktimes.com/survivor/cast/images/troyzan-robertson-bd3.jpg", "bio": "<p>From MSN.com's pre-game <a href=\"http://tv.msn.com/reality-tv/survivor-one-world/photo-gallery/feature/?photoidx=16\">interview</a> with <strong>Jeff Probst:</strong></p> <p><span class=\"smetertext\">\"</span><strong>Troy says:</strong> My life is centered around <em>Survivor</em> the last 11 years.

'I'm putting my brother through this so that I can do it again, really,' says Aras. 'It's for really selfish reasons. It's been seven years since my season finished — seven years almost to the day that I won a million dollars, and it's been a dream of mine to come back. I assumed I'd only be back for a winners season, so the chance to play again in a non-winners-only season is too good to be a true. And Vytas is a huge fan too.' But does Vytas have what it takes? 'Vytas's biggest weakness is his temper,' says Aras. 'When you have all this deprivation that occurs, it's hard to hold your tongue. If you're angry, that's going to scare people.
